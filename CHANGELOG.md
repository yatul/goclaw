# Changelog

All notable changes to GoClaw are documented here. For full documentation, see [docs.goclaw.sh](https://docs.goclaw.sh).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Bitrix24 channel migrated to imbot v2 messaging API** — outbound text now uses
  `imbot.v2.Chat.Message.send` (replacing `imbot.message.add`); bot verification/lookup
  uses `imbot.v2.Bot.list` (replacing `imbot.bot.list` + the legacy `imbot.list` fallback);
  bot teardown uses `imbot.v2.Bot.unregister` (replacing `imbot.unregister`). Bot
  registration intentionally stays on v1 `imbot.register` — v2 `imbot.v2.Bot.register`
  changes the event-delivery model (per-event handler URLs → `eventMode`), which would
  require rewriting the inbound event parser. No user-facing behavior change.

### Added

- **Dashboard can cancel and retry stuck team tasks** — new WS RPCs
  `teams.tasks.cancel` (any task not yet completed/cancelled; optional reason is
  posted as a comment) and `teams.tasks.retry` (stale / failed / cancelled /
  in_review, and blocked tasks that nothing blocks any more; a human comment is
  required and is both posted on the task and appended to the assignment prompt).
  Task detail dialog gets Retry and Cancel buttons. Previously these transitions
  were reachable only through the lead agent's `team_tasks` tool, so a task that
  ended up blocked or stale could not be recovered from the UI (#506).

- **Behavior UX sidecar delivery overrides** — Adds sidecar-generated Quick
  Acknowledgement and Intermediate Replies with provider/model, timeout, token,
  and char caps. Effective config resolves Channel > Agent > Workspace, with
  agent overrides stored in `other_config.delivery_behavior`.

- **Built-in skill `workspace-organizing`** — closes #71. Discipline skill that
  teaches agents to keep personal, team, and delegate workspaces tidy.
  Enforces a purpose-based folder convention with two modes: flat
  (`notes/`, `data/`, `outputs/`, `scripts/`, `archive/`) for ad-hoc work
  and project (`projects/<slug>/{docs,assets,source,reports,research}/`)
  for named multi-file work. Per-agent namespacing under
  `shared/<agent_key>/` prevents collisions in team workspaces. Integrates
  pre-write discovery via `vault_search`, `memory_search`, and
  `knowledge_graph_search` to surface related files before writing and
  avoid duplicates; documents Vault scope mirroring and id-routing rules.
- **Bitrix24 channel 2-way media (file) transfer** — Inbound media downloads via
  `imbot.v2.File.download` (one-time authenticated URL) with MIME preservation for
  images, PDFs, audio, and video. Outbound uploads via `imbot.v2.File.upload` (base64).
  Shared `media_max_mb` config knob (default 20 MB) caps both directions. Requires
  `imbot` OAuth scope (no `disk` scope needed). Inbound handled by new
  `internal/channels/bitrix24/download.go`; outbound by `send_media.go`. New
  `BaseChannel.HandleMessageMedia()` method centralizes media-aware message handling.
  See `docs/05-channels-messaging.md` § 16 (Bitrix24) for configuration.

- **Skill agent manage grants** — Adds per-agent skill edit/delete grants with
  backend checks, HTTP/WS support, SQLite and PostgreSQL schema updates, and web
  dashboard controls for granting and revoking manage access.

- **Packages Update Flow (Phase 2a: pip + npm)** — closes #900 (Phase 2a). Extends
  Phase 1 update infrastructure to pip and npm package sources. `/v1/packages/updates`
  now returns mixed-source results with an `availability: {github, pip, npm}` map.
  Multi-source UI with per-source filter pills; unavailable sources (binary not on PATH
  or Lite edition) hidden automatically. apk deferred to Phase 2b.
  See `docs/packages-pip-npm.md` for command matrix, runbook, and min versions.

- **Packages Update Flow (Phase 1: GitHub binaries)** — closes #900. Proactive
  "N updates available" badge + per-row `[Update]` + `[Update All]` on the
  Runtime & Packages page. Backend endpoints under `/v1/packages/updates*`
  (master-scope). ETag-aware polling (304 responses don't burn rate limit),
  stale-while-revalidate cache, atomic two-phase `.bak` swap with rollback.
  Pre-release detection via regex + GitHub API flag; semver ordering via
  `golang.org/x/mod/semver`; non-semver tags use string-inequality fallback
  with downgrade protection. WebSocket events `package.update.*` for owner
  clients. See `docs/packages-github.md` § "Updating Installed Packages".

### Changed

- **Behavior UX simplification** — Retires user-facing Tool Status Messages and
  deterministic tool-status channel text. Show Reasoning remains separate for
  debugging/testing, while Quick Acknowledgement and Intermediate Replies are
  delivery-only sidecar messages. Legacy `block_reply` config remains readable
  as an inherited Intermediate Replies default but is no longer exposed as a
  separate Web UI control.

- **ChatGPT Subscription (OAuth)** — default model and backend-owned model catalog
  now prefer `gpt-5.5`, with reasoning metadata and context-window defaults updated
  for provider-first model selection.

### Fixed

- **Quick Acknowledgement generated mode** — Generated acknowledgements now use
  the sidecar delivery generator instead of always falling back to fixed
  templates. Sidecar failures stay non-blocking and fall back to templates.

- **Intermediate Replies are sidecar-generated** — Tool-call progress no longer
  appends fixed "I'll use ..." text or relies on main-pipeline assistant content.
  Visible progress is generated from bounded delivery metadata and is kept out
  of session history.

- **Multi-attachment messages no longer trigger N agent replies (#63).**
  Three coalescing surfaces hardened so a single user action produces ONE
  agent run regardless of how the platform delivers attachments:
  1. **Bus debouncer** — removed the media-bypass shortcut that fired
     immediately for any message with attachments; media now goes through
     the same per-(channel, chatID, senderID, agentID) silence window as
     text. Media-floor (`max(configured, mediaFloor)`) guarantees a
     minimum window when attachments are present so multi-file uploads
     coalesce. Dedup seed prevents the same `MessageID` from being
     buffered twice on bursty arrivals.
  2. **Web Chat debouncer** (`internal/gateway/methods/chat_debounce.go`) —
     parallel structure for `/v1/chat/completions` streaming: per-session
     buffer + media floor + Take/Discard semantics for flush/cancel
     control. Merges queued payloads at flush time (latest params win;
     text concatenated newline-separated).
  3. **Telegram album aggregator** (`internal/channels/telegram/album_aggregator.go`) —
     channel-layer coalescing for albums. Telegram delivers a media-group
     (multiple photos/videos shared as one user action) as N separate
     `Message` updates sharing a `MediaGroupID`. The aggregator buffers
     by `(chatID, MediaGroupID)` after all access gates pass, pins the
     sender on first arrival as a security tripwire, and dispatches ONE
     `processResolvedMessage` call with all members on a 500ms silence
     window. `Stop()` synchronously drains pending buffers before
     `pollCancel` so in-flight albums always publish.

  Cross-surface invariants (see CONTRIBUTING.md → "Multi-attachment
  coalescing"): no media bypass, media floor on every surface,
  drop-and-log dual caps, no `time.Timer.Reset` (use `AfterFunc` +
  `Stop`), sender pin on first arrival, post-stop pushes rejected
  with warn log.

- **Upstream critical security remediation** — hardens gateway no-token fallback,
  Feishu/Lark and Pancake webhooks, sandbox path/write handling, tenant-admin
  checks for mutable HTTP surfaces, and Lite hook schema migration verification.

- **SecureCLI runtime npm binaries** — binary discovery and credentialed exec now
  resolve tools installed under the GoClaw runtime directories, including
  `{runtimeDir}/npm-global/bin`, and support single-binary npm package aliases
  such as `openrouter-cli` exposing `orc`.

### Breaking Changes

- **Context pruning now opt-in.** Previously tool-result trimming ran by default
  for all providers; now requires explicit `contextPruning.mode: "cache-ttl"` in
  `config.agents.defaults` to enable. Matches upstream TS design and prevents
  silent prompt-cache invalidation on Anthropic.

  Migration — add to `config.json5`:
  ```json5
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      contextPruning: { mode: "cache-ttl" }
    }
  }
  ```

### New Features

- **Pancake private-reply (comment → DM).** Enables a one-time DM to commenters
  after the public reply. Stateless on GoClaw side — no DB dedup table, no
  in-memory state:
  - Config: `features.private_reply` (bool) + `private_reply_message` (text).
  - **Template variables** `{{commenter_name}}` and `{{post_title}}` with
    literal-replace semantics (pre-sanitizes `{{`/`}}` from var values to
    prevent var-in-var substitution).
  - Empty `private_reply_message` → English fallback constant.
  - **Dedup strategy**: webhook-level comment_id dedup (already in
    `comment_handler.go`) + Facebook's per-comment idempotent `private_replies`
    endpoint handle duplicates platform-side. No GoClaw state required.
  - No DB migration.

### Improvements

- **Context pruning cleanup.** Removed redundant Pass 0 (per-result 30% guard),
  deduplicated double prune call per iteration, added SanitizeHistory to
  PruneStage for broken tool_use/tool_result pair cleanup.
- **Context pruning config backfill (migration).** Agents with existing custom
  `context_pruning` config (e.g., `softTrimRatio`, `keepLastAssistants`) but
  missing a `mode` field get auto-backfilled with `mode: "cache-ttl"` to
  preserve their intent after the opt-in flip. Rows with NULL config stay
  NULL (new opt-in default applies). PG migration 51; SQLite schema v19.
- **Pancake channel metadata routing.** Whitelist in
  `internal/channels/routing_metadata.go` now preserves `post_id` and
  `display_name` across the inbound → outbound hop so the private-reply
  template variables survive the agent pipeline round-trip.

### Fixed

- **Skill grant tenant isolation.** Agent skill grants now validate both the
  skill and agent tenant scope before insert, revoke, grant listing, or
  can-manage checks. Visibility auto-promote/auto-demote updates are scoped to
  the calling tenant or system skills so one tenant cannot mutate another
  tenant's skill.

- **Agent provider switching.** Saving an agent after changing provider/model now
  handles cleared ChatGPT OAuth routing config without writing SQL NULL into
  NOT NULL JSON config columns.
